#**emails.go**
In an authentication system, we often need to verify that a user actually owns the email address they claim to have. The `sender.go` module acts as the bridge between your application and the user's inbox. It abstracts the complexities of connecting to an email server so that other parts of the system (like the OTP module) can simply say "send this message to this user" without worrying about the underlying protocol.

**Function Signature**
```Go
func SendEmail(host, port, fromEmail, password, toEmail, subject, body string) error
```
**Parameters**
host: The hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).
port: The communication port required by the server (typically 587 or 465).
fromEmail: The sender's email address, acting as the authenticated identity.
password: The authentication credential (application-specific password or API key).
toEmail: The recipient's email address.
subject: The subject line of the email.
body: The main content payload of the email.

**Technical Implementation Details**
Authentication: It securely logs into the email server using standard authentication schemes (supported by Gmail, Outlook, AWS, etc.).

Message Formatting: It automatically handles the complex formatting required by email protocols (setting up headers like "To", "Subject", and "Content-Type") so the message appears correctly in the user's email client.

Delivery: It establishes a network connection to the server and transmits the message.

Return Value:
   Success: Returns nil if the email was sent successfully.
   Failure: Returns an error message if the transmission failed (e.g., invalid password, network issues, or blocked ports), giving you context on what went wrong.
